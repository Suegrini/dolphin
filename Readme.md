# Dolphin - LightGun Edition

A custom build of Dolphin made for LightGun Games.

Aim Correction + Recoil Support (MameHooker or Direct with Gun4Ir) + Crosshair Removal

Crosshair removal files are build upon those made by PiperCalls and the methodology to correct aim was inspired from Prof_glx Dolphin-Lightguns-Accuracy-Inis
https://github.com/ProfgLX/Dolphin-Lightguns-Accuracy-Inis

You must be configure your gun in joystick and set axis to make it works.

Some games will require custom controller configs to configure movements for reload for exemple.

Some extra options are availiable, like AutoLoad SaveState 10 on boot, quicker pointer (experimental), and per-game reshade profile.

How to use the Recoil : 

- Using Mamehooker, the option to enable it is a checkbox in the general tab in Options
- Using direct GunCon Com control. You can find the option to set the right com port in wii mote config in the pointer tab.
- Use of Sinden recoil is possible but need a modified version of the Sinden software that's i do not wish to make public yet.

To use recoil you need to use the exact same version of the game as me.

How to use Aim Fix : 

In wii mote config in the pointer tab, check Auto-Correct Aim
